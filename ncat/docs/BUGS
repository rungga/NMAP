Ncat BUGS
=========

[ DESCRIPTION ]

	Like its author, Ncat isn't perfect.  But you can help make it better
by sending bug reports or even writing patches.  If Ncat doesn't behave the way
you expect, first upgrade to the latest version available from http://nmap.org.
If the problem persists, do some research to determine whether it has already
been discovered and addressed.  Try Googling the error message or browsing the
nmap-dev mailing list archives at http://seclists.org.  Read the full manual
page as well.  If nothing comes of this, mail a bug report to nmap-dev@insecure.org.
Please include everything you have learned about the problem, as well as what
version of Ncat you are running and what operating system version it is running
on.  Problem reports and Ncat usage questions sent to nmap-dev@insecure.org are
far more likely to be answered than those sent to Fyodor directly.
	Code patches to fix bugs are even better than bug reports.  Basic
instructions for creating patch files with your changes are available at
http://nmap.org/data/HACKING.  Patches may be sent to nmap-dev (recommended) or
to Fyodor directly.

[ OUTSTANDING BUGS ]

This is a list of bugs which are already known about and
are not yet resolved:


* UDP listen support handles --exec'd input from certain
programs quite strangely. 

  Additionally, it has been pointed out that --exec'ing 
  "/bin/bash" with UDP and --listen for some reason 
  only reads 1 character at a time. For example, if
  you did an "ls\n" on the client side, the server
  would only read the "l" -- you can temporarily
  get around this rather bizzare problem by running
  your commands one character at a time.
 
  l
  s
  <return>
  
  ..will correctly display the file listing of the current
  working directory.
